## working on new reworks features

- what we want ?
  - we can do a rework, without doing a "pre work" ?
- what kind of problem will we face ??

  - untuk sekedar tidak cek previous step, we already finish. the problem here is :

    - join processs: already joined parts, cannot being scan anymore.
      on the previous solutions, we backup the data to a new tables, and delete on the original one.

    - how to make sure that we scan the right parts ??

## todo's today

- make new setting, for testing to identify current behaviour that contain :
  - scan board, join board with master
  - scan ticket with board
  - scan master with ticket
